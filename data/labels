For #1, the big challenge is to get data: https://www.google.com/search?sxsrf=ACYBGNSjn3g9UpPmGRy59lsSQv1JetJ9oA:1574460528250&q=real+people+that+look+like+anime&tbm=isch&source=univ&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiy3v7D6v7lAhVOKKwKHW2lBwwQ7Al6BAgFEBs&biw=1093&bih=463.  
A way that you could make this easier data-wise to find the celebrity that looks most like somebody.  That could be done using the celebA dataset: http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html.  

For #2, you would need to track points through the frames of the anime if you want to morph the person to an animated sequence.  

Make sure that you all contribute in coming up with the goals, research, and implementation.  It's really just the implementation that should be split up into sub-assignments.
